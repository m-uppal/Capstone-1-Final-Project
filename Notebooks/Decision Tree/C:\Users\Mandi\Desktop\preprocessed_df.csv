Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation d/b/a Advocate Medical Group,IL,Business Associate,2029.0,2013-09-13,Hacking/IT Incident,Network Server,Yes,"Advocate Health Care Network (Advocate) has agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), for multiple potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) involving electronic protected health information (ePHI). Advocate has agreed to pay a settlement amount of $5.55 million and adopt a corrective action plan.  This significant settlement, the largest to-date against a single entity, is a result of the extent and duration of the alleged noncompliance (dating back to the inception of the Security Rule in some instances), the involvement of the State Attorney General in a corresponding investigation, and the large number of individuals whose information was affected by Advocate, one of the largest health systems in the country. 
“We hope this settlement sends a strong message to covered entities that they must engage in a comprehensive risk analysis and risk management to ensure that individuals’ ePHI is secure,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes implementing physical, technical, and administrative security measures sufficient to reduce the risks to ePHI in all physical locations and on all portable devices to a reasonable and appropriate level.”
OCR began its investigation in 2013, when Advocate submitted three breach notification reports pertaining to separate and distinct incidents involving its subsidiary, Advocate Medical Group (""AMG""). The combined breaches affected the ePHI of approximately 4 million individuals.  The ePHI included demographic information, clinical information, health insurance information, patient names, addresses, credit card numbers and their expiration dates, and dates of birth. OCR’s investigations into these incidents revealed that Advocate failed to:
•conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to all of its ePHI;
•implement policies and procedures and facility access controls to limit physical access to the electronic information systems housed within a large data support center;
•obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a written business associate contract that its business associate would appropriately safeguard all ePHI in its possession; and
•reasonably safeguard an unencrypted laptop when left in an unlocked vehicle overnight.
Advocate Health Care Network is the largest fully-integrated health care system in Illinois, with more than 250 treatment locations, including ten acute-care hospitals and two integrated children's hospitals.

UMass will pay $650,000 and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.

UMass notified OCR that a workstation in its Center for Language, Speech, and Hearing (Center) was infected with a malware program which resulted in the impermissible disclosure of electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 1,670 individuals, including names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance information, diagnoses and procedure codes. The University determined that the malware was a generic remote access Trojan that infiltrated their system, providing impermissible access to ePHI, because UMass did not have a firewall in place.

OCR’s investigation indicated the following potential violations of the HIPAA Rules: 
• Failure to designate all of its health care components when hybridizing
• Failure to implement technical security measures at the Center to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI transmitted over an electronic communications network by ensuring that firewalls were in place at the Center
• Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis prior to September 2015
• Impermissible disclosure of 1,670 individuals’ ePHI 

In addition to the monetary settlement, UMass has agreed to a corrective action plan that requires the organization to conduct an enterprise-wide risk analysis; develop and implement a risk management plan; revise its policies and procedures, and train its staff on these policies and procedures.

Metro Community Provider Network,CO,Healthcare Provider,3200.0,2012-01-27,"Hacking/IT Incident, Other",Email,No,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) settlement based on the lack of a security management process to safeguard electronic protected health information (ePHI). Metro Community Provider Network (MCPN), a federally-qualified health center (FQHC), has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $400,000 and implementing a corrective action plan. With this settlement amount, OCR considered MCPN’s status as a FQHC when balancing the significance of the violation with MCPN’s ability to maintain sufficient financial standing to ensure the provision of ongoing patient care. MCPN provides primary medical care, dental care, pharmacies, social work, and behavioral health care services throughout the greater Denver, Colorado metropolitan area to approximately 43,000 patients per year, a large majority of whom have incomes at or below the poverty level.

On January 27, 2012, MCPN filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a hacker accessed employees' email accounts and obtained 3,200 individuals' ePHI through a phishing incident. OCR’s investigation revealed that MCPN took necessary corrective action related to the phishing incident; however, the investigation also revealed that MCPN failed to conduct a risk analysis until mid-February 2012. Prior to the breach incident, MCPN had not conducted a risk analysis to assess the risks and vulnerabilities in its ePHI environment, and, consequently, had not implemented any corresponding risk management plans to address the risks and vulnerabilities identified in a risk analysis. When MCPN finally conducted a risk analysis, that risk analysis, as well as all subsequent risk analyses, were insufficient to meet the requirements of the Security Rule.

“Patients seeking health care trust that their providers will safeguard and protect their health information,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “Compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule helps covered entities meet this important obligation to their patient communities.”
